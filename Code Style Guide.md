# Code Style Guide

We care about how our code's style is done. Plenty of open and closed-source projects
neglect the fact that they should take care of how their code looks like,
driving away potential contributors and team members from reviewing the code efficiently.

There are four things we should should pay attention to:
* Brace style type
* Indent size

## Brace style type

We are using the [Allman Brace Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Allman_style)
for all our Node.js projects.  
That way we make sure we write a clear and lucid piece of code. The deviation from the standard Node.js coding style,
which is [K&R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#K.26R_style), was made in order to get a clearer, more structured
code overview, reducing time to get accustomed with the project.
